# Project Overview

This repository contains a Java-based project that focuses on implementing and testing specific algorithms or functionalities as described in the provided task instructions. The project leverages Gradle as its build automation tool, ensuring a streamlined build process and dependency management.

## Implementation

The core implementations are located within the `src/main/java` directory. The project structure and Gradle build scripts are set up to support Java 17, ensuring compatibility and leveraging the latest language features for optimal performance and readability.

## Testing

Testing is a crucial part of this project. The tests are located in the `src/test/java` directory and are designed to validate the functionality of the implementation. To run the tests, you can use the following commands:

- On Unix-like systems: `./gradlew test`
- On Windows: `gradlew.bat test`

## Guidelines

This project is part of an assignment for the algorithms and data structures class at AAU Klagenfurt. More guidelines on the implementation can be found in the `docs/` folder:
